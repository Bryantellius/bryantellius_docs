# Environment Setup

## IOS or AndroidOS Devices

The easiest way to get started is by using the Expo CLI. You can install with `npm i -g expo-cli`.

From there, just use `expo init NewProject` to bootstrap a new React Native project.

A bootstrapped Expo/React Native project structure will resemble the following:

```txt
.expo-shared/
    assets.json
assets/
    adaptive-icon.png
    favicon.png
    icon.png
    splash.png
node_modules/
.gitignore
App.js
app.json
babel.config.js
package-lock.json
package.json
```

Then, just like React, get started with edits in the `App.js` file.

## TV Devices

For developing a React Native app for TV devices, see [Building For TV](https://reactnative.dev/docs/building-for-tv)
