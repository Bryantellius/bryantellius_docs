# Appendix A Notes

_Dependency Injection_ refers to "passing necessary parts of functionality to another part of the program to complete work." (e.g. the callback passed to `Array.prototype.map`)

_Inversion of Control_ refers to "handing off control of your program to another part of the program."

> "Notably, Martin Fowler cites IoC as the difference between a framework and a library: with a library, you call its functions; with a framework, it calls your functions."
