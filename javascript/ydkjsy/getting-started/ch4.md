## Pillars of JS

1. Scope and Closure

   Scopes contain variables and define their visibility within lexical (nested) scopes

   Variables and function declarations are _hoisted_ to the top of the scope

   The exception is with `let`/`const` declared variables, that are _hoisted_, but due to the _Temporal Dead Zone_, are unusable

   _Closure_ defines the ability of function values (first-class citizens) to retain the scope visibility from their definition, even if they are called in another scope

2. Prototypes

   Classes are _syntax sugar_ for _prototypal inheritance_, the inheritance of properties from a parent

   But prototypes are just links between objects

   _Behavior delegation_ is the alternative object usage in JS (tbc...)

3. Types and Coercion

   JS coerces (converts) data types of values to execute code

   Knowing JS Types and how implicit typing works is KEY to being an advanced JS developer

## Author Spillage

JavaScript is not C#, Java, Python, Ruby, etc.

Learn to code JavaScript the JavaScript way. It can be enticing to code JS from other language styles, but that would be very limiting.
