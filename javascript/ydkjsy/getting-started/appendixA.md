# Appendix A

Primitive value types are passed by _value copy_
Structured value types are passed by _reference copy_

Functions are first-class citizens, aka treated as regular non-primitive values

You can define functions in a multitude of ways:

`function name() {}`
`const name = function () {}`
`const name = function oldName() {}`
`const name = () => {}`
etc
