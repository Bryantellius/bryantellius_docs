# Chapter 7 Notes

Closure can be defined as values that are enclosed within an inner _function scope_ that can be referenced and re-assigned after the outer scope no longer exists.

Closure is beneficial because it saves program computation by allowing variables to be "remembered" in other areas of a program, while still maintaining scope encapsulation and POLE principles. It also brings about cleaner function invocations by allowing for less parameters needed per function depending on enclosed values.
