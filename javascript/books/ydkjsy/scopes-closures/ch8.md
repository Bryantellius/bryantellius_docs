# Chapter 8 Notes

> "A module is a collection of related data and functions (often referred to as methods in this context), characterized by a division between hidden _private_ details and _public_ accessible details, usually called the 'public API.'"

Namespaces and Data Structures are examples that use either stateless grouping or encapsulation respectively, but not both. Both are similar to a module, but one examples of one.

A single, central instance of a module is called a _singleton_ (traditionally created with IIFE's).

_Module factories_ were used to create new instances of a given module.

_CommonJS_ modules act as _singleton_ modules.

_ESM_ modules are _singleton_ modules.
