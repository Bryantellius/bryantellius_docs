# Chapter 1 Notes

- Brendan Eich, the creator of JavaScript
- JavaScript was originally code-named Mocha, but called LiveScript at NetScape
- "Script" referred to lighter weight programs, so Java + Script was created to target Java developers with the hint that lighter, yet similar programs could be written for the web
- FUN FACT: Oracle (formerly Sun Systems) owns the trademark for "JavaScript", yet never really enforces it
- TC39 is the committee manages the latest JS specifications at ECMA
  - 50 - 100 volunteer members from an array of Web companies
  - Meet every other month to discuss progress
- "One JS version to rule them all", any used JS is of the ECMAScript specification.

> There used to be JScript, a Microsoft implementation of JS, but it has long since died out

- JS environments will give a different development experience. Web browsers, node.js, etc have unique APIs that extend or enhance the JS development in that environment.
- JS is a _multi-paradigmed_ language, meaning you can write a program with _Object Oriented_, _Functional_, and _Procedural_ programming styles
- JS is _backwards compatible_, meaning that any code written in previous versions of the language would still run appropriately in a modern JS engine (NO OLD CODE BREAKS THE WEB)
- Being backwards compatible, newer JS code in older JS engines could cause errors. This is why tools like _Babel_ are used to transpile newer written JS to compatible versions on older JS engines
