## The Agile Manifesto: Values

"We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it. Through this work we have come to value:"

- individuals and interactions
- working software
- customer collaboration
- responding to change

## The Agile Manifesto: Principles

1. Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery fo valuable software
2. Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for teh customer's competitive advantage
3. Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale
4. Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project
5. Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done
6. The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation
7. Working software is the primary measure of progress
8. Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely
9. Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility
10. Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount of work not done--is essential
11. The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams
12. At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly
