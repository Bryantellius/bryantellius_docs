# Troubleshooting Your Agile Project

## Risk Identification

Risk analysis techniques

- brainstorming session
  - risk identification meeting
  - identify risks
  - quantify risks
  - estimate risk impact (loss and recovery)
  - exposure of risk (chance of risk x lost days)

## Risk Tracking

1. Hold risk identification meeting
2. Create risk register
3. Monitor your risks

Assess your risk register during sprint planning meetings.

- is it still a risk?
- do we need to do anything during this sprint to address this risk?
- owner of risk
- mitigation plan (prevention of risk)
  - do these risks need stories?
- escalation path (product owner?)
- _risk burndown chart_ (risk exposure, days, across iterations)
