# Team Performance

## Establish Your Team Foundation

Roles

- Project Sponsor
- Project Owner
- Scrum Master
- Development Team

Focusing on the goal of the project can help determine which roles to give each team member.

Team norms are the ground rules that guide a team's interactions. You should hold team norm sessions and review them regularly.

## Generalize Your Team

Team members need to be able to play more than one role, one at a time.

_Generalizing Specialist_, you can help out beyond your specialty.

Set the expectation early on that all team members need to have more than one skill.

_Swarming_ is when team members use more than one skill to help out towards the team's goals.

## Collaboration and Commitment

Agile teams are _co-located_.

Team Space

- Product Vision
- Task board
- Design modals
- Team Norms
- Burn Charts

_Osmotic Communication_ is when team members gain information by overhearing others.

_Caves and Commons_ is designed to give team members both common spaces to interact with others and space to be with themselves.

With distributed teams

- Create frequent check-ins each day
- Consider two stand-ups if necessary
- Use digital white boards, messaging, meetings, charts, etc

## How To Get To A Stable Velocity

Charts

- Burn charts
  - burn down (story points/effort by time/iteration)
  - burn up (scope of project by time/iteration)
- Velocity tracking chart (bar graph with commitment and completed bars by iterations)

Goal is for teams to achieve _stable velocity_, which is story points completed each sprint with a difference of +- 10%.

Divide total points by number of sprints to get stabilized velocity.
