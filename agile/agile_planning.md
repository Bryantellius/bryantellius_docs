# Agile Planning

## Agile Planning Overview

_Product Vision_, _Roadmap_, _Release Plan_ act as input to the _Product Backlog_

Less detailed with room for change.

Sprint plans are more detailed.

## Creating an Agile Release Plan

- Focus on the end customer
- Each release is something that matters to the customer
- Must be flexible and open to change

## Experimenting and Prototyping

Agile prototypes "discover what we did not know; not a validation tool"

Experiments can keep the team on track by not wasting time with decisions.

## Themes, Features, Epics, and User Stories

"Progressively Elaborate"

_Themes_ describe a group of functionality
_Features_ describe a group of functionality
_Epics_ are large user stories that can be broken down into more detail
_User Stories_ are small functionalities that are valuable to the customer

## Refining the Backlog

Continually estimating, analyzing, prioritizing and breaking down user stories
