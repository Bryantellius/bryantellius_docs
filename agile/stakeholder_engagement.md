# Stakeholder Engagement

## Engage Your Stakeholders

1. Identify your _stakeholders_ (who will be impacted by the project)
2. Educate your stakeholders about agile
   - Sponsors and executives: success rate
   - Managers: self-organizeing teams and their role
   - Developers: autonomy
   - Users: feedback
3. Give expectation of time involvement
4. Acknowledge and thank involvement

## Collaborate Across Stakeholders

Involvement -> Engagement

The goal of agile is _participatory decision making_, which leads to _collective agreement_ and _shared collaboration_.
