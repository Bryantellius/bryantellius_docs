## The Cost of Multitasking

Limit the teams' multitasking.

Sprints define a timeline that is a goal to complete a small set of tasks, which can increase focus.

## Avoid Work Handoffs

Limit handoffs to optimize work throughput.

## The Penny Game

Smaller batches result in faster throughput and increased production.

## Deliver at a Predictable Pace

Predictable = Sustainable and Constant

User stories are written to represent batch work, and batch work is typically worked on in sprints (short time frames)

## Cross-Functional Teams

Ideally, a team is small, motivated self-organized group of generalists.

Silos create more handoffs

Each member focuses on the work, not their specialty

## User Stories

User stories are more about conversations rather than requirements and center around customer value.

The product owner focuses on what the customer wants, and the team focuses on the how.

## User Stories: Common Challenges

- too big/involved
- no clear value
- too technical
