# Modern Software Development

## The Agile Mindset

- more generalists instead of specialists
- small changes to embrace change

Teams should be able to ask questions about defining requirements.

The first step is the _why_.

## The Rise of Knowledge Workers

Managers are becoming less directive and more _supportive_ due to a change in knowledge worker hierarchy.

Agile focuses on servant leadership and collaborative team management.

## Challenges with Software Manufacturing

Traditional software project management came from manufacturing project standards that were considered "waterfall" approaches. Each stage took time and lead to the next (e.g. plan, build, test, release).

Agile focuses on iterative and incremental decision making and development to optimize the _cone of uncertainty_.
