## Backlog Refinement Techniques

Breaking down features

- examine features from a user POV
- evaluate the value by brainstorming scenarios
- minimal viable meaning
- broken down into user stories
  - which can be broken down even further for any single user story to be completed in one sprint

Persona

- character that represents a specific user
- helps build shared understanding of the product values and users

Primary Persona

- product satisfies all of their needs

Secondary Persona

- product satisfies most of their needs

Tertiary Personas

- supplemental users, not the focus of the product

User Stories

- As a... I want... so that... format
- INVEST model
  - independent
  - negotiable
  - valuable
  - estimable
  - small
  - testable

Story Map

- organizes user stories in a visual map
- can represent details and priority, themes and time
- can help identify MVP

Story Slicing or Splitting

- breaking down user stories into smaller increments of value
- _not broken down by technical component_

Acceptance Criteria

- criteria that defines when the product feature fulfill the user requirements
- limit to 10 statements
- written from the user's POV

User Story Workshops

- hands on workshop where the team practices crafting user stories
- reiterate the product vision
- review product road map
- revisit personas

## Product Backlog Prioritization

Prioritization is all about _value to the customer_.

Forced Ranking Prioritization

- rank top 5-10 items that must be worked on first/next
- compare every two items to reach the ranked order
- must align to business priorities and value
- may need to split the team into groups
  - can also be prioritized by persona consideration

Categorization, Grouping Prioritization

Common Methods

- grouping items into high, medium, and low
- MoSCoW (Must have, Should have, Could have, Won't have)

Voting Prioritization

- gets the team to discuss priorities
- 10 or less items to vote on
- offer context on the items
- set up the criteria for voting
- set up voting process

Buy a Feature

- prioritization technique
- must pool money together to purchase features
- only distribute 40-70% of total cost of features

## Key Concepts for Agile Teams

Definition of Ready

- how the team members decide if they are ready to move forward
- defined by the team
- used with user stories
- sets consistent team expectations
- keeps teams accountable

Definition of Done

- how the team members decide if a work item is done
- defined by the team
- used to self manage and continuously improve
- code quality, documentation, testing, code review, etc
- applies to all user stories

Technical Debt

- taking shortcuts that can impact future sprints
- reduces pace and velocity

Minimizing Technical Debt

- have a strong product vision and road map
- create a meaningful definition of done

Dealing with Technical Debt

- identify important functions and estimate time to build quality features
- allocate points towards a technical backlog for each sprint to deal with issues

## Agile Meetings and the Product Owner

Estimating

- based on the team's velocity from previous sprints
- relative sizing technique
  - t-shirt sizing
  - points
  - fibonacci
  - planning poker
- may need pre-estimating session

Sprint Planning Session

- team leader facilitates, product owner decides what's built next
- defines sprint goal
  - 1-2 sentences defining the goal of the sprint
  - can be a learning goal
- looks at items ready for next sprint
- clarifies tasks and requirements of sprint tasks

Daily Standup, Scrum Meeting

- 15 minutes
- product owner and entire team attends
- everyday
- discuss
  - What did you do yesterday?
  - What you will do today?
  - What are your blockers?
- identify issues, not solve them (do that in another time/meeting)
- not just a status update meeting

Sprint Review and Demo

- end of sprint
- demo for stakeholders (or team)
- informal and natural form of displaying work done in a sprint
- where to determine if the work is accepted or needs more work

Retrospectives

- meeting to improve how the team works together
- occurs after the sprint
- results in actionable items to improve the team's processes
  - must be implemented in the next sprint (continuous improvement)
