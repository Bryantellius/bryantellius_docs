# Continuous Improvement

## Review and Adapt Your Practices

_Kaizen_, Japanese meaning small improvements over time.

_Agile Retrospective_ is a practice of continuous improvement in Agile.

- what went well
- what can be improved
- what can be done differently to improve

_Process tailoring_ can add value to your project, but should only be allowed if it avoids added risk.

## Demo Your Deliverables

Demo work to stakeholders often.

- Sprint demo
  - completed stories
  - identify stories that were accepted or not
  - demostrate working product
  - stakeholders identify what was missing/wanted (may already be in product backlog)
- Product demo
  - collective product as it's being built
  - after each release
  - shows overall user experience
  - close with a preview of upcoming features

## Develop Team Abilities

Build T skills (i.e. generalize).

Encourage team members to branch out their skill set to help the team.

_Skill chart_ defines needed roles and skill sets needed on a project. Assign members to roles to learn and grow their skills.

_Communities of Practice (CoP)_ allows members to share knowledge and subject matter with other team members to grow their skills.

## Assess Your Efficiency

_Lean_ is a way to identify and eliminate a system's waste without affecting productivity.

Typical wastes

- partially done work
- extra processes
- extra features (_gold plating_)
- task switching
- waiting
- motion
- defects

How to identify wastes

- _Value stream mapping_ is a drawn mapping/flow of steps a valuable item flows through your system from start (wishlist) to finish (end user)
- _Throughput_ how much value is delivered through the whole process
