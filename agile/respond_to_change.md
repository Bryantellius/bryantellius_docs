# Respond to Change

## Inspect and Adapt

Welcome and expect change _anytime_ during development. This is why Agile encourages shorter timeframes and interations.

## Stay Within Timeboxes

Predictability handles uncertainty in a project by delivering and experimenting frequently to improve the project.

Timeboxing feeds into predictability and creates a sustainable environment and output.

## Jump Off the Waterfall

Agile is a mindset, waterfall is a strict step-by-step process

Iterative development and delivery vs. phased project management

## Commit to Sprints

_Sprints_ are short, structured timeboxes that define one iteration during the development lifecycle of a product.

- stand up meetings where team members describe their progress
- sprint planning
- sprint retrospective

## Iterative Delivery

Iterative delivery is a common practice to refine product development through each sprint iteration.

This allows the customer to get value after every sprint.
