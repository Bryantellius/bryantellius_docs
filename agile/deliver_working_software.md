# Deliver Working Software

## Start with the Highest Value

_Pareto Principle_, or 80/20 principle, 80% of the effects come from 20% of the efforts.

Break down user stories and require documents by highest value features.

## Prioritize with a Taskboard

Taskboard is a swim lane diagram that includes columns for TODO, DOING, and DONE with user stories in each.

## Avoid PowerPoint Software

Frequent delivery involves small, releasable versions of the product.

Only show customers _working software_, not wireframes or powerpoint slides with illustrations/mockups.
