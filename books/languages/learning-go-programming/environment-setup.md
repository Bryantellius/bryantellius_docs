# Environment Setup

Go is designed to run on most used operating systems, including Windows, Mac OS, and Linux.

Main Compilers

- `gc` default compiler with recursive descent parser and custom loader
- `gccgo` part of the GNU compiler collection

Install Go from [golang.org](golang.org) to get started. You can download the installer for easy start up.

You can uninstall Go at any time by removing the `go` folder.
