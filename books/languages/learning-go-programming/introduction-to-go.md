# Introduction to Go

Golang is an open-source programming language.

Characteristics

- statically typed
- compiles to a single binary
- automated garbage collection ("mark and sweep")
- supports concurrency
- built-in testing library
- built-in standard library
- cross-platform
- built-in documentation tool

> Although golang is _like_ an object-oriented language, it does not conform to the strict industry definition (i.e. it doesn't support inheritence or method overloading)

Pain Points

- doesn't support compile-time generics
- doesn't have `try-catch` structure to streamline error handling
