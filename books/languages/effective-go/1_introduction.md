# Effective Go: Introduction

> Although this book is considered a must read and the Go language has remained stable since it's publication, it is not maintained, and will not cover the newest additions and practices of the language.

Golang was released in 2009 with inspiration from C++, Java and other languages. However, it is different, and should be treated as such when designing and implementing Go projects. This book will cover an extensive range of essential topics in Go.
