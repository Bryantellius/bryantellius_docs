## Chapter 1: Designing Systems

With increasing challenges due to the growth of the web and media, designing your own system for your needs greatly increases overall effectiveness and flexibility.

Guidelines included with creating a design system:

1. Brand Identity - logos, typography, color palettes, messaging, collateral, etc
2. Design Language - design direction and philosophy
3. Voice and Tone - guidelines for company/organization voice (resolute) and tone (dependent on situation)
4. Writing - guidelines detailing writing restrictions and improvements
5. Code Style Guides - patterns, examples and conventions for how to write code

### Style Guide Benefits

Style guides are used to create a consistent user interface that all parties (designers, developers, 3rd parties, users) are familiar with.

"Web style guides promote consistency and cohesion across a user interface."

"Style guides establish a consistent, shared vocabulary between everyone involved in a project, encouraging collaboration between disciplines and reducing communication breakdowns."

"A pattern library communicates the design language in a very tangible way, which helps stakeholders understand that an underlying system is determining the final interface."

"By making a style guid a cornerstone of your workflow, designers and developers are forced to think about how their decisions affect the broader design system It becomes harder to go rogue and easier to think of the greater good."

### Style Guide Challenges

It's a _long-term investment_, not a short-term payoff.

Style guides are _time consuming_.

They get treated as _nice to haves_ because they are viewed as ancillary projects.

Style guides must be _maintained and governed_.

Style guides often lack the exposure to achieve their true potential: to be helpful tools for _everyone involved, not just designers and developers_.

Style guides end up being a large pool of modules, instead of a _structured library_.
