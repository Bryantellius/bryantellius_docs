# Introduction

_Problem Solving_ resolves around

1. Design
2. Implementation
3. Testing
4. Refinement

There are two general design strategies: _top down_ or _bottom up_ designs.

**Top down** design takes the problem, and breaks it down into smaller and smaller parts until a solution is found.
**Bottom up** design starts at with designing the smallest pieces and making a interactive, coherent solution.
