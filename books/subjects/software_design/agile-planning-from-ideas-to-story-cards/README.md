## Notes

_Agile_ is "an incremental approach to building [software projects], such that a team is in position to change directions quickly."

The four values of agile are:

1. Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
2. Working software over comprehensive documentation
3. Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
4. Responding to change over following a plan

Along with the four core values are [12 principles](http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html).

For example, number 7 states, "Working software is the primary measure of progress."

The whole focus is to get to _working software_. Once there, you can obtain user feedback and continue the agile iterative process of prioritization of features, implementation, testing, releasing, and feedback.

> The Pareto Law states when applied to software development states that 80% of users will only use 20% of features.
