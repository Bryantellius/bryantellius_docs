## Notes

_Agile_ is "an incremental approach to building [software projects], such that a team is in position to change directions quickly."

1. Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
2. Working software over comprehensive documentation
3. Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
4. Responding to change over following a plan
