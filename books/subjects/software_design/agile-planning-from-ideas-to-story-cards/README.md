### What is Agile?

_Agile_ is "an incremental approach to building [software projects], such that a team is in position to change directions quickly."

The four values of agile are:

1. Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
2. Working software over comprehensive documentation
3. Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
4. Responding to change over following a plan

Along with the four core values are [12 principles](http://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html).

For example, number 7 states, "Working software is the primary measure of progress."

The whole focus is to get to _working software_. Once there, you can obtain user feedback and continue the agile iterative process of prioritization of features, implementation, testing, releasing, and feedback.

> The Pareto Law states when applied to software development states that 80% of users will only use 20% of features.

Agile is focused in four primary feedback loops:

1. Business Cycle
2. Planning Cycle
3. Release Cycle
4. Sprint Cycle

### Business Cycle

At the highest level, the business cycle includes _identifying a need_, _conceptualizing a solution_, _building a solution_, and _measuring user feedback_. This cycle can vary in time depending on the size and product of the company, and should be flexible to change.

### Planning Cycle

Planning cycles are used to create a set of features and deliver releases to end users. These features are based on _personas_ of users and the solutions they need. 

### Release Cycle

The Software Release iteration involves planning and implementing _feature_ releases, as opposed to releasing the entirety of the software at once.

### Sprint Cycle

The Sprint cycle is the feedback loop for the development process. Typically 2 to 4 weeks, development teams prioritize, divvy, execute and review work on features.

### The Planning Process

The planning process has the following stages:

- Application Concept: What is the application solving? Who is it solving it for?
- Developing Personas: Describe the user.
- Writing Scenarios: Describe how the user would use the software to solve their problem.
- Storyboarding and Wireframes: Visualize the application and how the user would interact with it.
- Writing Epics: More specifically describe how the user would use the software to solve their problem based on the storyboards and wireframes.
- Breaking Down Epics to Stories: Create _user stories_ by further breaking down epics into issues that create product value. These will go into the _product backlog_.
