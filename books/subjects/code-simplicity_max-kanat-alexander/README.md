## Chapter 1: Intro

To improve the result, you must improve the code.

"Programming, in essence, must become the act of reducing complexity to simplicity."

Every developer on a team is a software designer.

## Chapter 2: The Purpose of Software

"The Purpose of software is to _help people_."

"...your potential ability to write good software is limited only by your ability to conceive of helping another."

## Chapter 3: The Future

The Equation of Software Design: D = V / E

- D: desirability of a change
- V: value of a change
- E: effort involved with completing a change

"The desirability of any change is directly proportional to the value of the
change and inversely proportional to the effort involved in making the
change"
