## Chapter 1: Intro

To improve the result, you must improve the code.

"Programming, in essence, must become the act of reducing complexity to simplicity."

Every developer on a team is a software designer.

## Chapter 2: The Purpose of Software

"The Purpose of software is to _help people_."

"...your potential ability to write good software is limited only by your ability to conceive of helping another."

## Chapter 3: The Future

The Equation of Software Design: D = V / E

- D: desirability of a change
- V: value of a change
- E: effort involved with completing a change

"The desirability of any change is directly proportional to the value of the
change and inversely proportional to the effort involved in making the
change"

### What is Value?

"The degree to which this change helps anybody anywhere"

Research is an important way to gauge prospective feature value

Value is composed of two elements:

- the probability of value (how likely is the feature capable of creating change)
- the potential value (how much change can it create)

"Calculating a change's value includes considering how mch harm it may do, and balancing that against the help it brings."

### What is Effort?

Effort is usually measured in hours worked.

It is important to consider _all time spent_ on a project or feature, not just time spent programming. This may include communication time, programming, brain storming sessions, research, etc.

### What is Maintenance?

Maintenance includes the effort and value of a feature over _time_.

Features take effort to be maintained. Some features more than others.

Features may increase or decrease in value over time.

So when calculating value and effort, maintenance, current value, and future value must also be considered.

Ultimately, "the desireability of a change is directly proportional to the value now plus the future value, and inversely proportional to the effort of implementation plus the effort of maintenance."

**Reducing the effort of maintenance is more important than reducing the effort of implementation.**
