# Creating a Module

Create a new module with `go mod init <host>/<module_name>`, which with generate a `go.mod` file to track your module dependencies.

Initially, it will include your module name and the `go` version your project runs on. As you add dependencies, the `go.mod` file will reflect the name and version of each dependency used in your code.
