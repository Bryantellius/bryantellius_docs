# Java Modules

Modularity is used to break up code bases into smaller, manageable, and even independent code spaces that form larger applications.

A _Module_ is a group of related code or resources that is collected under a unique name (_namespace_).

Each module has a module descriptor that describes the code and accessibility of its code with the outside world. This information is found in a `module-info.java` file inside of the module directory.
