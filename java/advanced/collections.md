# Java Collections Framework

Collections are containers for grouping objects together. Depending on use case, you should use a different collection that suits your needs of speed, order, memory, etc.

All types of Collection implement the Iterable interface.

The three main types of Collection are: `Set`, `List`, and `Queue`:

## Set

A Set is a Collection data type that is _unordered_ and contains _no duplicates_.

## List

A List is a Collection data type that is _ordered_ and contains _duplicates_.

## Queue

A Queue is a Collection data type that is _ordered_ and operates in FIFO operations.
