# Gatsby Notes

Source: [Gatsbyjs Tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/tutorial/)

## Getting Started

Install the Gatsby CLI globally with `npm install -g gatsby-cli`

With the Gatsby CLI installed, use `gatsby new` to prompt the creation of your new project.

You will be asked set up and configuration questions about your project, like the name, JS or TS support, CMS selection, style system, and more.

Once the project is created, you can start the development server with `gatsby develop`.

## Adding Plugins

_Plugins_ (3rd party npm packages) can be added to your project by:

1. Installing the package via npm
2. Configuring the use of the plugin in the `gatsby-config.ts` file under `plugins`
