# Getting Started

Install the Gatsby CLI globally with `npm install -g gatsby-cli`

With the Gatsby CLI installed, use `gatsby new` to prompt the creation of your new project.

You will be asked set up and configuration questions about your project, like the name, JS or TS support, CMS selection, style system, and more.

Once the project is created, you can start the development server with `gatsby develop`.
