# System Design and Architecture Notes

## What

SOA, or _Service-Oriented Architecture_, "separates functions into distinct units, or services, which developers make accessible over a network in order to allow users to combine and reuse them in the production of applications."

The core principles of SOA are:

1. **Business value** is given more importance than technical strategy.
2. **Strategic goals** are given more importance than project-specific benefits.
3. **Intrinsic interoperability** is given more importance than custom integration.
4. **Shared services** are given more importance than specific-purpose implementations.
5. **Flexibility** is given more importance than optimization.
6. **Evolutionary refinement** is given more importance than pursuit of initial perfection.

## Why

Since Service-oriented architecture can be implemented with web services or microservices, services can be framework agnostic (implemented in new and legacy applications) with functional building-blocks accessible over standard internet protocols.
